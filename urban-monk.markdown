## Chatper 9: Never Enough Money

* Money is a form of energy. AKA currency, it flows in current and channels just as much as water or electricity. Thus, good money management is about good energy economics.
* Saving money requires an awakened, disciplined mode of being in order to be cultivated. Both a state of mind and a state of being.
* Humans are motivated to do all sorts of wacky things for a variety of reasons, but money is often how these root imbalances show up.
  - A quick read of the financials of a business can tell you a *lot* about how it is doing and how its managed.
  - Likewise, you can see quite deep into someone's life and mind by examining their personal finances.
  - This is because money is energy. Financial statements document the *flow* of this energy through someone's life
- Regarding mass media, advertising, &c: "There's no reason to take arrows all day because, in a weak moment, you will bleed."
- While entrpreneurs know how to take on a debt burden and leverage it to rapidly scale a business, **consumer debt** makes people indentured servants to their lifestyles.
* Where should we spend our money?
  - on things that promote health and vitality
  - on useful products that are free from poisons and toxic chemicals
  - on a sustainable investments that secure the future of ourselves and our families
  - at companies that are closely connected and giving back to their communities
  - on causes that protect nature and humanity's collective future

* It's time for a fundamental rethinking: benefit corps, NGOs, co-ops, and "regular" companies have been emerging around the globe and, more or less, practice the Buddhist precept of "right livelihood."
* It **is** possible for companies to turn a profit, do good work, and contribute to solutions to larger problems facing the world.
  - By incorporating this directly into the identity, mission, and values of the company, owners, employees, and customers can be justifiably and collective righteous and full of integrity.
