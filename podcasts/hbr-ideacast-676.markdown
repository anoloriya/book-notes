## The Right Way to Get Your First 1,000 Customers

- Common wisdom says that startups and other businesses are likely to find success if that create a product or service that is "10 times better" than anything else on the market.
- Entrepreneurs frequently look to major firms like Uber or AirBnb and attempt to emulaten them. What is the sense in emulating a firm with millions of customers?
- Uber, AirBnb, Pinterest, and many others did **not** attempt to scale from day 1.
- Instead they placed enormous emphasis on locating pockets of demand where the alternative product offering was *nothing* and trying like hell to achieve operational excellence in that particular space.
- The value they provided was in that level of service, not on their technology. In most cases, their tech was quite weak at the start.
  - Uber would manually summon a black car for you.
  - AirBnb started as literally renting an Aerobed with the promise of a hot meal in the morning.
- The pocket of demand that they found, however, were crucial in earning them their first 10, 100, 1000 customers.
  - Uber concentrated on sporting events, festivals, and other congested areas where the consumer's choice was effectively cab or no cab. No high technology.
  - AirBnb concentrated on DNC and RNC conventions, SXSW, and the like where hotels were literally at 100% occupancy. Consumer choice a place to stay or no place to stay. No high technology.
  - Etsy doggedly showed up at arts and crafts fairs and other festivals to recruit craftsmen to their platform---knowing that these merchants would bring their own custoemrs to the site. No high technology.
  - Amazon also did not have high technology, they started literally just by slining books online but they owned the customer experience end-to-end.
- All of these companies are like icebergs. The innovative technology that they are presently known for is just the tip. The actual core driver of their success has been a relentless focus on operational excellence. While tech did eventually become a differentiating factor for these firms, this was not the case in the early days.
- Put another way: there is no point in doing things that are meant to scale if your firm doesn't even survive that long; focus on small things done well in your early days.
- Ask yourself: **what is the primary driver of value for my consumer and how does that get delivered to them?**
  - It is probably not you are presently calling your innovative tech.
- If, in fact, the value is primarily being delivered to the consumer via an app or your tech, then it may be necessary for founders to partner with a technical co-founder/CTO early on.
- In the beginning, it's critical that you are humble about what you've actually got, but it's also okay to fake it a little bit until you make it.
- Technology as an enzyme: enzymes take a reaction that would proceed anyway under normal conditions and either speed it up or lower the energy required to complete, but they do not directly drive the reaction.
- In the early days, the goal is to learn, not necessarily to go fast: what did we learn by acquiring this customer? What did we learn by servicing them? What did we learn by losing this other customer?
