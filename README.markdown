Notes from books and other interesting things we've read. Enjoy!

Quick description of how we take notes:

> On my Macbooks, we use either the [Calibre](https://sigil-ebook.com/) ebook manager, [Sigil](https://sigil-ebook.com/) or a physical book at a desk, as well as the markdown file open in a text editor (usually [Atom](atom.io) or [Xray](https://github.com/atom/xray)(**note:** Xray is experimental software) it doesn't matter).
>
> When we read something that we want to summarize, we mentally commit it to memory and Command-Tab over to the text editor and type it out in Markdown. Don't copy-and-paste, because this solution allows for better retention of the information and allows for resrtucturing of the passage of interest (usually editing for length).
>
> Humnan memory is generally not good enough and it's necessay to Command-Tab back and forth, re-reading it in the Kindle app, and then re-reading your typing.
> 
> No highlights or any fancy exporting. Sorry if that's anti-climactic.
> 
> For physical books, we have the text editor open on a laptop, and then the physical book betwixt. But the algorithm is very similar 😛
